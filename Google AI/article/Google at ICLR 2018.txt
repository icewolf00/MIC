Google at ICLR 2018Posted by Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow, Head of Google Research and Machine IntelligenceThis week, Vancouver, Canada hosts the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2018), a conference focused on how one can learn meaningful and useful representations of data for machine learning.  ICLR includes conference and workshop tracks, with invited talks along with oral and poster presentations of some of the latest research on deep learning, metric learning, kernel learning, compositional models, non-linear structured prediction, and issues regarding non-convex optimization.At the forefront of innovation in cutting-edge technology in neural networks and deep learning, Google focuses on both theory and application, developing learning approaches to understand and generalize. As Platinum Sponsor of ICLR 2018, Google will have a strong presence with over 130 researchers attending, contributing to and learning from the broader academic research community by presenting papers and posters, in addition to participating on organizing committees and in workshops.If you are attending ICLR 2018, we hope you'll stop by our booth and chat with our researchers about the projects and opportunities at Google that go into solving interesting problems for billions of people. You can also learn more about our research being presented at ICLR 2018 in the list below (Googlers highlighted in
